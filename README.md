# alertLT

An iOS application that shows live LTC bus arrival times. 

This application allows users to add their favorite stops and quickly view arrival times for all routes at that stop. 
The application also provides an intuitive quick search feature for users to quickly search arrival times for any stop.

The app gets its data from the LTC's [WebWatch Service](http://www.ltconline.ca/WebWatch/MobileADA.aspx) and stores it locally in a Core Data database.
